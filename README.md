## AXIOM \(must\-see\!\)


</div>

### Description

Axiom: (FIXED missing files)

Text and HTML Processor and Filter. THIS IS A MUST SEE.

Compile to Exe and start using it.

OR check the code it will teach you LOTS of things,like:

* REGULAR EXPRESSIONS: if you don't know what RegExp's are then YOU ARE MISSING A LOT, check my code to see how you can replace hundereds of lines of code with a couple of lines!

* PLUG-IN DLL's * Save/Restore Settings Class.

* String Lists Class, like those in Delphi !

* Text file access Class, fast object access to text files.

* INI file Class.

* File History (MRU) Class.

* Fast String Concatination Class.

* ActiveX User Controls: Flat Button, Open Dialog with Preview,...

* LOADS of functions for handling Text and HTML files.

* API Stuff: Add bitmaps to menus, subclassing and callbacks, ...

* more....

most of the API code came from many sources, so i take no credit for them,

but the rest (and most) of the code is mine.

VOTES and FEEDBACK are welcome.

for suggestions or questions mail me on: highlander@nycny.net
